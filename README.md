### About This Portfolio 
This repository represents the beginning of my journey as a graduate student at **George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health**, where I am pursuing my **M.S. in Health Data Science: Bioinformatics**.  
My work bridges public health and computational research, with growing interests in **pharma, biotechnology, genomics, and epidemiologic data science**.  
Through this portfolio, I aim to build and share projects that demonstrate how data-driven methods can advance **biomedical discovery, public health analytics, and population-level research**.  
More projects will be added over time as I continue expanding my technical and domain expertise across these fields.
