### Project Overview
This project focused on developing and refining Python scripts to process and merge **spectral data from multiple LED measurements**. The goal was to combine wavelength and intensity data from four separate tab-delimited files (Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow LEDs) into a unified dataset where each row contained wavelength values followed by corresponding intensity values for all LEDs.  

The project demonstrates key **applied scientific computing skills** relevant to **bioinformatics and health data science**, including file I/O, data merging, conditional filtering, command-line arguments, and optimization for memory efficiency.

### Methods and Workflow
The project involved six progressive tasks:

1. **Baseline File Merging** — Ran the original Python script (`filestoXYYY.py`) to understand its merging logic and output.  
2. **Implementing `enumerate()`** — Replaced manual counters with Python’s built-in `enumerate()` for cleaner and safer loops.  
3. **Adding Skip-Line Parameter** — Modified argument parsing to allow user-defined header lines to skip.  
4. **Wavelength Filtering** — Introduced numerical filtering to include only wavelengths ≥ 400 nm.  
5. **User-Defined Wavelength Range** — Expanded filtering functionality to accept user-specified min/max wavelength values.  
6. **Memory-Efficient Implementation** — Restructured the processing loop to reduce memory use by streaming data line-by-line instead of storing it all in memory.
